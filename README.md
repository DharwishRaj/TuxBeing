# About the software

This program is developed on golang.It uses the focused window property of the xorg-server and calculates the time spent in each window and adds it to a json file, the golang gui is basically html and css this reads the json file and represents it as a chart.As this window appears and the keyboard is disabled and the window is unkillable.
